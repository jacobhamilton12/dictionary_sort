# dictionary_sort
Data structure I made to see if it will be faster than heapq. Currently it is not, though there are some optimizations that can be made

Run tests with ```poetry run pytest -v -s```


## General Idea
Sort of a mash up between counting sort and fenwick tree. Each level is for number of digits. It will pop the top smallest numbers first.

Ex, 
```python
[54, 13, 667, 98, 1] ->                   [[{1: {}}]
                           [{5: {4: {}}}, {9: {8: {}}}, {1: {3: {}}}]
                                       [6: {6: {7: {}}}}]]
```
